# Tailor Resume Manager
## Visit at https://natkai2040.github.io/tailor-resume-manager
This app is for everyone struggling to find a job, who endlessly modify their resume to get a slight advantage on every different job they apply to. 

The primary goal of this app is to keep track of the different versions of your resume, abstracting them down into lists of work experience and projects, and for each work experience and project, a tailored description. Both the job lists and the tailored descriptions are specific to that resume, but they can also be resused in other resumes. Abstracting the resume in this way allows the reuse of different jobs to fit multiple resumes.

- People will be able to edit and download different versions of their resume, and see which descriptions correspond to which resumes.

The seconday goal of the app is to display a greater breadth of a person's work experience. People are more than the limited amount of work they can fit onto one or two pieces of paper. People are more than just skilled in one area of their life that will fit one job. 

- People will be able to display all the jobs, classes, and projects that do not fit on their resume. Additionally, the descriptions for the jobs will encompass more than just a single purpose.

Finally, if people wish to, the third purpose of this app is to allow users to query an AI on their existing work, to tailor resumes and job descriptions for a certain job. 

- The AI will be able to view only the descriptions provided by the user in order to tailor them to a certain job. In this way, the AI does not invent any experience out of thin air, and can potentially highlight useful skills that the user has demonstrated, that will be helpful for the specific job.
